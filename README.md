**Steps on how to create GitHub page?**
Firstly, create a repository named after your username then .github.io (ex: hahaha.github.io), next, in your local device, create a html file named "index.html" and push it into github.  
 Lastly, go to your repository and in the top bar go to settings > in the left navigation bar click pages > set the source as deploy from branch > select main as the branch > press save.  
 After a few minutes, github pages will deploy the index.html and you can freely add a .css file to style your website.  

**What are your key takeaways from this exercise?**
